# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Demodulator for RC Receiver with different Outputs"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
    Decodes PWM-Signal from RC Receiver with counter and threshold values to decide wether to set the output to HIGH or LOW.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
    The program can be tested by applying a PWM-Signal to the input with a longer pulse time than 1.9ms, then the output will go to HIGH. If then you apply a PWM-Signal with a pulse time lower than 1.1 the output will go to LOW.
    
    Additionally the 7-Segment-Display will always show how many outputs are currently active (HIGH).
